# ImageResizer
This project is an image resizer application built using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and implemented in Python. The application allows users to resize images while maintaining the aspect ratio and preserving image quality.

## Features
Resizing with AI: The image resizer utilizes state-of-the-art AI algorithms to intelligently resize images. It employs advanced techniques to ensure that the resized images maintain their visual quality and avoid common artifacts such as blurriness or distortion.

Aspect Ratio Preservation: When resizing images, the application automatically maintains the original aspect ratio, preventing images from appearing stretched or distorted. This ensures that the resized images remain visually pleasing and true to the original content.

User-Friendly Interface: The image resizer comes with a user-friendly graphical interface that makes it easy for users to interact with the application. Users can easily select the desired image file, specify the target dimensions, and initiate the resizing process with a simple click.

Batch Processing: The application supports batch processing, allowing users to resize multiple images simultaneously. Users can specify a directory containing multiple images, and the resizer will automatically process each image in the directory, saving the resized versions with the same filenames or a custom naming scheme.

Output Customization: Users have the flexibility to customize the output settings according to their requirements. They can specify the output directory to save the resized images, choose the desired image format (e.g., JPEG, PNG), adjust the compression level, and apply additional post-processing options if needed.
